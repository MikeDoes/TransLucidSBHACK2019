## Code Samples

The project is structured in 3 parts:

1. Flask Master: The web-based user-interface for doing all the necessary manipulations with the blockchain. I. e. sending coins, checking the wallet status, analytics and block exploration.
2. BCFrontEndInteraction is meant to enable data to be passed on from the blockchain to the web-application service
2. Blockchain: The ERC 20 and Ethereum smart contract



## Installation
